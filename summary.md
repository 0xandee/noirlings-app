- Removed unused variables `showTooltip`, `setShowTooltip`, `tooltipPos`, `setTooltipPos`, and the unused function `toggleExercisesSidebar` from `packages/playground/src/components/editor/NoirEditor.tsx`.
- Removed all references to these variables and function, including event handlers and commented-out tooltip JSX in the draggable separator.
- This resolves TypeScript errors TS6133 and allows the build to proceed successfully.
- Removed the unused function 'toggleExercisesSidebar' from NoirEditor.tsx to resolve a lingering TS6133 error reported by TypeScript.
